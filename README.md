# CPEN-400Q-Project
By: Jerry Xu, Nicholas Ng, Matthew Stefansson, Ying Qi Wen
## Requirements and Dependencies
- Pennylane
- Numpy
- CPEN 400Q Lecture 8 Helper Code
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn
- Treelib

## Instructions
1. To run our code make sure you have the Requirements and Dependencies installed above
+ In our demo and experiment files we attempt to pip install the required packages if you click run all but it is better if you install them yourself
2. Finally to run the demo and experiment jupyter notebooks click the run all button

## File explanations
- The demo jupyter notebook is what we used in our presentation demo
- The experiment jupyter notebook is a fully commented and fleshed out example that reproduces the paper that was assigned to our team
- The test jupyter notebook is scratch work that lead to a fully fleshed out experiment jupyter notebook.
